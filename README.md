**👋 Hello, I'm Chuc, a GIS/Remote Sensing developer. 🌍**

🛰️ I'm deeply committed to harnessing the power of geospatial data, both through conventional spatial analysis and cutting-edge machine learning and deep learning techniques. I've developed open source projects like the Vertical Photo Placer plugin for QGIS 📸.

💡 I like to build GIS and Digital Earth/Datacube systems with Deep Learning/Machine Learning, SQL and NoSQL databases, Docker, Python, modern backend APIs (FastAPI/NestJS), and modern frontend frameworks (ReactJS/NextJS).  🚀

Currently, my primary focus is on web systems, but I also dedicate time to maintaining and enhancing desktop open source projects. 😊

If my open source projects are useful for your product/company you can also sponsor my work on them. ☕🌟
